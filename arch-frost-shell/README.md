## Arch-Frost Theme

http://osendott.github.io/arch-frost/

Numix-Frost theme customized with Arch in mind, with custom gnome-shell theme to match.

This is work in progress, shell-them based from the original EvoPop-Shell.
I am using a compiled (04-29-15) version, formatted manually and then edited. 

If you would like to grab the original source files, head on over to:

If you wish to grab the official version, head to:
https://github.com/alex285/evopop-shell-dist

Also, please check out the EvoPop GTK theme and Icons:

GTK theme based from Numix-Frost theme, original sources in AUR
or available upon request.

Comments/Commits are always welcome!
