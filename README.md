## Arch-Frost Theme

Matching Gnome-shell theme for Arch-Frost-GTK theme.

If you're reading this on GitHub, and are using an Arch based distro, open a terminal and type:


yaourt -S arch-frost-shell

Also, if you want to change the Arch "A" logo at the top, I have included a generic
icon to replace it with. Navigate to /usr/share/themes/arch-frost-shell/assets and replace
overview.svg with overview.old and reboot shell. (alt+f2 R <enter>

comments/suggestions are always welcome, you can contact me at the address below.
